//Assignment: Write code that makes an image in the style of Mondrian by drawing lines and colored rectangles.

/*Assignment: Do something different. 
Pick a particular feature of Mondrian's work--perhaps the angles, colors, shapes, or strokes, or something else--
and modify it in your sketch. Give us your own take on Mondrian!*/
